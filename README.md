# **Hello world!**

This is my repository that contains basic/advanced Java programs. This comes from my passion to learn Java and become proficient 
at the langauge by a certain amount of time.

You will see as time progresses, the programs that I create will become more sophiscated/complex in algorithmetic behaviour. During this time, I will make the attempt of improving my documentation and efficency in my code. 

_[Here is a project that I had participated in](https://github.com/prasvpatel/Spot_Bot)_

### thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my programs as much as I do.

### Note for myself:
- _Java does not allow you to print data of string so easily.. it requires extra steps. Here are the steps:_

  _Type in Arrays.toString(arrayType);_
