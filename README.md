# Aim Bot Program <subsidary of computerRocket>
The main purpose of this program is to use allow users to automatically get headshots on other "Players" within any First-Person shooter (FPS).

Notes to keep in mind: 
  - Program is still under development therefore, _PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED IN THE PURPOSAL YET._
  - There are more features that will be added into the program at a later date (such as Artifical Intelligence (i.e. the program is able to play like the normal player itself)).
  
Thank you for reading!
