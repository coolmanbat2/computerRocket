# **sideJavaProjects**

This repository contains all working side projects that I have completed in Java. 

Feel free to use the code in your own projects; and if you want to, _you can help improve the code I have posted corresponding to the runnable jar file_ (Just a note: the file 'keyboardMaps.jar' is supposed to correspond to 'simpleAutoTyper'. I forgot to rename the file but that will be fixed soon.)

**Thanks for reading!**
